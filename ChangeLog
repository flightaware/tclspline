    * Upgrade to Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA) 3.7.

    * Compiles cleanly under Debian.  Added README.Debian with configuration
      instructions.

    * A missing "return TCL_OK" in the code path that handles the case where
      the number of elements being passed are too few to spline was causing
      Tcl panics because it fell through into code where it didn't belong,
      causing it to try to set a value into a shared object, causing Tcl
      to panic.

    * Update to Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA) 3.6 -- the configure script
      started failing on newer versions of the OS.

    * Make it not dump core if the passed point list is empty.

    * Require an even number of elements in the point list.

    * Make it return the passed list unchanged if the point list contains
      only 2 or 4 points (one or two coordinate pairs.)

    * Bumped version to 1.0

    * generic/tclsplinetcl.c:  Allow safe interpreters to use the spline
      function.

    * README: Cleanup

    * generic/tclspline.c: Fixed memory leak.  More rigorous checking
      of list contents (at least 6 elements, even number of elements.)

    * tests/spline.test: Some actual, useful, functional tests.
